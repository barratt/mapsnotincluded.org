                    "answer": "The map explorer is where you can browse maps that contributors have submitted. These maps contain detailed information on geysers, POIs, etc. The world trait finder contains limited information on every seed that can exist, even if a contributor hasn't submitted it yet. Once you find some seeds you like, you can request them and they will be viewable within the map explorer once the requests have been filled."

                    "answer": "Using the map explorer, you can either search for specific DLC biomes, or enter a mixing preset (using the \"Mixing: -/-\" field). The easiest way of getting the mixing preset you want is by going to the world trait finder, configuring your mixing settings and copying the last section from the example seed. It should look something like \"E6A87\"."

                    "answer": "Next to the reset and search buttons, there is a clipboard button allowing you to copy the link to your search query. When this link is pasted into your browser, it will automatically apply the filter settings associated with that link."

                {
                    "question": "What does requesting a map do?",
                    "answer": "When you request a map, it's added to the request queue. Once the request is filled by a contributor, it will be available to view in the map explorer. Maps added to the queue first are last to be filled, which means that you can request as many maps as you want without clogging the queue for days."

                    "question": "How does DLC mixing affect geysers?",
                    "answer": "Biomes which haven't been replaced via mixing will keep their geysers. However, biomes which have been replaced will have their geysers deleted, with new ones generating across the map."
