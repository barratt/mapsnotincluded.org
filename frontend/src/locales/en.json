Download and unzip the latest mod build from the {githubReleaseLink}.\n4. Put the files in the local folder.\n5. Start Oxygen Not Included and enable the mod. It won't work if there are any other mods enabled. You may also need to disable default save to cloud in Oxygen Not Included settings.\n\nAdditionally we're looking for feedback on the site, if you have any suggestions or found a bug, please come and share your thoughts on {discordLink}.\n\nAnd finally, if you know anything about the world generation process in Oxygen Not Included, we would love to hear from you.
