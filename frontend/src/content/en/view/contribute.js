    "gamer": `Please donate your compute power and upload saves to make this tool better for everyone.

To do this, please follow the instructions below.
1. Locate your ONI mod folder. It is usually in C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents\\Klei\\OxygenNotIncluded\\mods.
2. Go into or create a folder named "Local" (case sensitive on linux).
3. Download and unzip the latest mod build from the {githubReleaseLink}.
4. Put the fild in the local folder.
5. Start Oxygen Not Included and enable the mod. It won't work if there are any other mods enabled. You may also need to disable default save to cloud in Oxygen Not Included settings.

Additionally we're looking for feedback on the site, if you have any suggestions or found a bug, please come and share your thoughts on {discordLink}.

And finally, if you know anything about the world generation process in Oxygen Not Included, we would love to hear from you. We're always looking to improve our understanding of the game and the tools we build around it.`,
